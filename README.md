# QuBeads
QuBeads is an interactive qubit simulation software that uses the BEADS Representation to provide a rich visualization of qubit system dynamics in quantum information. The BEADS Representation is a general complete approach for the visualization of qubit system states. It is used in combination with a quantum-mechanical simulator to graphically visualize qubit system time evolution.

# The BEADS representation
QuBeads uses the BEADS representation (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01446) to visualize the dynamics of qubit systems.
##Video showcase
A high-resolution video showcasing various dynamical simulations underlying the figures in the article referenced above can be found in *Releases* (right). In the *Releases* section, navigate to *QuBeads-Video*. The video (*BEADS.mp4*) is available in the corresponding *Assets* dropdown.

# How to install QuBeads
Download the binary for your operating system in *Releases* (right) and follow the instructions below.
## Windows
Run the installer file *QuBeads_1.0.0_beta1.exe*. Follow the onscreen instructions. As this app is not included in the Microsoft App Store, running the installer may be blocked. In this case, allow Windows to run the installation manually.
## MacOS
Open the image file *QuBeads_1.0.0_beta1.dmg*. Drag and drop QuBeads into your applications directory.<br>
If your MacOS prevents QuBeads from opening after installation (due to this software not being distributed via the AppStore), you can still allow the software to run. Choose *System settings* in the *Apple menu*, click *Privacy & Security* and enable QuBeads to be opened.
## Linux
Save the binary (*QuBeads_1.0.0_beta1.deb* or *QuBeads_1.0.0_beta1.rpm* depending on your distribution) in a directory of your choice. Install by running one of the following commands in a terminal inside your directory.
### Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
`sudo dpkg -i QuBeads_1.0.0_beta1.deb`
### RedHat/CentOS/Fedora
`sudo rpm -ivh QuBeads_1.0.0_beta1.rpm`<br><br>
You can add SpinDrops to your system path by running<br>
`PATH=${PATH}:/opt/QuBeads`
