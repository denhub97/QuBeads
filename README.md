# QuBeads
QuBeads is an interactive qubit simulation software that uses the BEADS Representation to provide a rich visualization of qubit system dynamics in quantum information. The BEADS Representation is a general complete approach for the visualization of qubit system states. It is used in combination with a quantum-mechanical simulator to graphically visualize qubit system time evolution.

# How to install SpinDrops
Download the binary for your operating system in releases (right) and follow the instructions below.
## Windows
Run the installer file *QuBeads_1.0.0_beta1.exe*. Follow the onscreen instructions.
## MacOS
Open the image file *QuBeads_1.0.0_beta1.dmg*. Drag and drop QuBeads into your applications directory.<br>
If your MacOS prevents QuBeads from opening after installation (due to this software not being distributed via the AppStore), you can still allow the software to run. Choose *System settings* in the *Apple menu*, click *Privacy & Security* and enable QuBeads to be opened.
## Linux
Save the binary (*QuBeads_1.0.0_beta1.deb* or *QuBeads_1.0.0_beta1.rpm* depending on your distribution) in a directory of your choice. Install by running one of the following commands in a terminal inside your directory.
### Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
`sudo dpkg -i QuBeads_1.0.0_beta1.deb`
### RedHat/CentOS/Fedora
`sudo rpm -ivh QuBeads_1.0.0_beta1.rpm`<br><br>
You can add SpinDrops to your system path by running<br>
`PATH=${PATH}:/opt/QuBeads`
